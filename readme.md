# Simple math implementations with C

## I. Numbers (v0.0.1 - stable)
* Real
* Complexe

## II. Vectors (v0.0.2 - unstable)
* entity â€” description of math structures so we can create
  * Polynomes (i.e. vectors)
  * Matrix (i.e vectors columns & lines)
  * Fractions (i.e 2 vectors)

## III.Functions (work in progress)
* differentials
* Newton search algorithm


##### What's new!
* Making use of void* to adapt with all the structures.
* Introducing math entities
